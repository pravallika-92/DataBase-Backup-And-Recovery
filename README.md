## MySQL

### Backup
Run:
```bash```
bash backup_mysql.sh

bash restore_mysql.sh

bash backup_postgres.sh

bash restore_postgres.sh 

Description:

Backing up and restoring databases is a fundamental aspect of database administration and system reliability. These processes ensure that data can be recovered in case of system failures, hardware crashes, human error, or malicious attacks. The backup and restore scripts provided here focus on two widely used relational database management systems: MySQL (or MariaDB) and PostgreSQL.

Each system has its own command-line tools for managing backups. For MySQL, the main tools used are mysqldump for backups and the mysql command for restores. For PostgreSQL, the tools used are pg_dump for backups and pg_restore for restoring data from backups. Each pair of scripts is designed to automate these tasks and save backup files with timestamps, making management and retrieval easier.

MySQL Backup and Restore

The backup_mysql.sh script uses mysqldump to export the entire contents of a specified database into a plain SQL file. This includes tables, data, and schema definitions. The script saves the backup in a structured folder and appends the current date to the filename to prevent overwriting old backups. This approach ensures that there is a historical record of backups that can be referenced or restored later.

The restore_mysql.sh script reads the SQL backup file and uses the mysql command-line tool to import the data back into a MySQL database. This is useful in scenarios where the database has been lost, corrupted, or when data needs to be cloned into a development or testing environment.

PostgreSQL Backup and Restore

The backup_postgres.sh script uses pg_dump to create a backup in custom format, which is more flexible than a plain SQL dump. The custom format allows for selective restoration of individual tables or objects, parallel processing, and more efficient storage. Like the MySQL script, it appends a timestamp to the filename to keep track of versions.

The restore_postgres.sh script uses pg_restore to restore the data from the custom format file. The -c flag tells the tool to clean (drop) the existing database objects before restoring them, ensuring the restore process does not cause conflicts due to existing objects. The script requires valid database credentials and assumes that the target database already exists.

Why These Scripts Matter

These scripts help system administrators automate critical processes that would otherwise require manual execution and increase the chance of human error. They are essential in:

Disaster recovery planning

Daily or weekly backup automation

Database migration across environments

Cloning databases for testing or development
